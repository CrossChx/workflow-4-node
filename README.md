Workflow 4 Node (LGPL-3.0) - PRERELEASE
=======================================

Workflow 4 Node is (gonna be) a [.NET Workflow Foundation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee342461.aspx) like framework for Node.js. The goal is to reach feature equivalence and beyond.

## Milestone 1

Being able to implement Correlated Calculator in Workflow 4 Node by using MongoDb persistence:

Readiness: 99%

It's basically completed, but a [weird Windows clustering issue of node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/7691) prevent me to release it right now. I hope the fix will be released soon.

## Milestone 2

DESIGNER!

I have some early drafts and trying to show you some screenshots soon. It will be exciting and really different from the .NET WF's version.  

Readiness: 10%

Stay tuned ...
